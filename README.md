## Project Overview
![Image of Truck]()

Remote control car for our ENEL 300 design class at the Schulich School of Engineering at University of Calgary.

Our car integrates a variety of features including distance measurement, metal detection, togglable head/tail lights, tank steering, and more. These features are implemented through 3 custom PCBs, designed in Altium or KiCad. Wireless locomotion control and light control is implemented using the HC-05 bluetooth transciever module. The physical design was inspired by a RAM 3500 Cummins 6.7 Twin Turbo and its stereotypical owner *(Devon)*. This allowed us to bring a part of Alberta culture to the academic enviroment through innovatation and design.

## Team Dynamic

The workload of the various systems  was divided amongst us based on interest and skill. Coleman was responsible for implemeting metal detection and distance measurement, in addtion to working on bluetooth communications, and controller design. Procter was responsible for ECU, power regulation, interboard communication, general code management and reveiew. Garcia was responsible for sofware development, 3D design and printing, and product selection. Calvin was responsible for motor driver development, 3D design, and Bluetooth communications.
